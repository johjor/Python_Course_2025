# A Deep Dive Into IMDb's Movie Ratings

**Ever struggled to choose the perfect Friday night movie? Same here. In this project, you'll find a summary of top-rated movies on IMDb, complete with cool visualizations — maybe it'll help you decide!**

*This repository primarily contains data, Python scripts, and plots for a project required by the course HEL-8048 25V Advanced data and visualization using programming at UiT The Arctic University of Norway.*

This repository is created to take a deeper look into the database of IMDb (Internet Movie Database). The database contain information related to films, television series, podcast, video games etc. At IMDb you can find information about cast, production crew, plot summaries etc. In this project I will focus on movie titles, the release year, age rating, genres, IMDb rating, number of users who rated the movies and number of user reviews for the movies.

In this project I have mainly used Pandas to manage, filter and sort the data. Different methods and functions from Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to adjust plotting and data visualization. Several visualization styles are used to plot the data. I use Jupyter Notebook in VScode to write code and markdown files, commenting my choices through the process. 

You can see the information about the repository organisation below.
*To view the final results and conclusions, see Hel8048_project.md in the /results folder.*

Below you will find more information about the organization of this repository, the source of data and further details.

## The Source and Structure of Data

The data used in this project was initially downloaded from kaggle with Kagglehub API. The downloading process is further explained in the file: download_kaggle_dataset.ipynb.

**The data reflects a collection of metadata from 1500 movies from from 1936 to 2020.**

IMDb (Internet Movie Database) provides information about films, TV series, podcasts, video games, and more — including cast, crew, plot summaries, ratings, and reviews. This project focuses on:
- Movie titles
- Release year
- Age rating
- Genres
- IMDb rating
- Number of user ratings
- Number of user reviews

## Repository Organization

- `/data`  
  Contains the `.csv` file with the dataset.

- `/plots`  
  Stores figures generated by scripts.

- `/results`  
  Contains final results and visualizations with captions. The main notebook `Hel8048_project.md` is here — check it out to see the end results.

- `/scripts`  
  Includes scripts for each hypothesis. These scripts handle filtering, grouping, and plotting. There's also a "class plotting" file where I'm experimenting with reusable plotting functions — still a work in progress!

- `/source`  
  Contains the image used in this `README.md`.

- `download_kaggle_dataset.ipynb`  
  Demonstrates the KaggleHub API download process.

## Hypothesis
H1: Movies with a higher number of reviews are more popular — and therefore, I have likely seen them.  
H2: The number of reviews is positively correlated with the number of raters.  
H3: Movies released in 2010 or later tend to receive higher ratings than older movies.  
H4: The "Action" genre has become more popular over recent decades.  
H5: Most movies in the dataset fall under the **PG-13** category, as blockbuster movies often aim for this rating to maximize audience reach.
